module Bu3424
#=
by default the bustec dll is found at C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\VISA\Win64\Bin\bu3424.dll.  
There is probably a pointer to this path somewhere in the system

The functionality of this library is found in C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\VISA\Win64\bu3424\bu3434.chm or bu3424.txt.

Probably use @ccall instead of ccall for this project.
